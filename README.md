Hackathon Challenge: Referral Dashboard Design
In the digital world, referral systems are key. They're not just a way to get more business; they're what make a brand trustworthy and respected. When someone recommends a business, it's like giving it a seal of approval, which is far more valuable than any advertisement.

Having a good system to track referrals is essential. It's not just an extra feature—it's a must-have. Why? Because without it, businesses miss out on:

Saying thanks to people who bring in new customers.
Seeing clear patterns in how customers find them.
Making the experience better for everyone based on real recommendations.
Spreading good words about themselves in a way that's honest and trackable.
Improving what they offer based on what customers really like.
Simply put, without tracking referrals, businesses are missing out on the best kind of marketing there is—the kind that comes from happy customers telling others about their great experiences.

The Challenge: Crafting Visions into Dashboards
Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to architect two dashboards that are not just tools, but storytellers for the users: the GrowthSchool (GS) and the Referrer. These dashboards will serve as the lens through which the intricate dance of data and referrals is viewed and understood.

# Dashboard 1: The GS Interface
For the meticulous overseers of the referral program.

Total Referral Overview: A quick glance at the numbers that matter.
Referral Status Tracking: Status of each referral (

e.g
., pending, approved, rejected).
Referral Sources: Know where your strengths lie. What is the Source of the referral.
Impact Gauges: Dashboards doubling as a compass for program effectiveness.

# Dashboard 2: The Referrer's Chronicle
For the networkers turning connections into growth.

Successful Referral Count: Celebrate every victory.
Individual Referral Status: Follow the journey of each referral.
Referral History: Your past successes, Record of the previous referrals and pending one or in the process.
